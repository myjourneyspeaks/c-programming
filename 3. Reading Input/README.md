# Reading Input

To obtain input, `scanf()` function is used to capture user input. The _f_ in `scanf` and `printf()` , stands for “_formatted_” and both of these function require the use of a _format string_ to specify the appearance of the input or output data.

To read an `int` value:

```c
scanf("%d", &variable_name); // reads an integer and stores into variable_name
```

Reading a `float` value:

```c
scanf("%f", &variable_name); // reads a float and stores into variable_name
```
