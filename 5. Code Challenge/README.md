## Challenges

1. Write a program that computes the volume of a sphere with a _10-meter radius_, using the formula _v_  = 4/3π $r^3$. Write the fraction 4/3 as `4.0f/3.0f` . (Try writing it as 4/3 . What happens?).
2. Modify the program of Programming Project 2 so that it prompts the user to enter the radius of the sphere.
3. Write a program that asks the user to enter a dollars-and-cents amount, then displays the amount with _5% tax added_.
4. Write a program that calculates the remaining balance on a loan after the first, second, and third monthly payments: 
	- Enter amount of loan: 20000.00 
	- Enter interest rate: 6.0 
	- Enter monthly payment: 386.66 
	
	- Balance remaining after first payment: $19713.34 
	- Balance remaining after second payment: $19425.25 
	- Balance remaining after third payment: $19135.71 
	
- Display each balance with two digits after the decimal point. Hint:  Each month, the balance is decreased by the amount of the payment, but increased by the balance times the monthly interest rate. To find the monthly interest rate, convert the interest rate entered by the user to a percentage and divide it by 12.
