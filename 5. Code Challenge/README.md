## Challenges

1. Write a program that computes the volume of a sphere with a _10-meter radius_, using the formula _v_  = 4/3π $r^3$. Write the fraction 4/3 as `4.0f/3.0f` . (Try writing it as 4/3 . What happens?).
2. Modify the program of Programming Project 2 so that it prompts the user to enter the radius of the sphere.
3. Write a program that asks the user to enter a dollars-and-cents amount, then displays the amount with _5% tax added_.
